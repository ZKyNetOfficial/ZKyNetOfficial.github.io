                            <p>Upon launch, ZKyNet plans to offer monthly ($4 CAD/month) and annual ($35 CAD/year) subscription plans. These prices are estimates and may change before the Service becomes generally available. All subscriptions will renew automatically at the end of each billing period. You authorize ZKyNet to charge the applicable subscription fee at each renewal.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">All prices will be listed in Canadian Dollars (CAD). If you pay in another currency, your payment provider may apply its own conversion rate. Applicable taxes will be calculated and added at checkout based on your jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Payments will be processed by Stripe. ZKyNet will accept card payments only at launch. ZKyNet does not store your full payment details.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">If your payment method fails, your account access will continue until the end of your current paid period and will not renew.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">We will notify you by email of any price changes before your subscription renews at the new rate. You may cancel before the renewal date if you do not accept the new price.</p>
