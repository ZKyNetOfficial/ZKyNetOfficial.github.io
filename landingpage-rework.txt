# ZKyNet Landing Page Comprehensive Update Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan transforms the ZKyNet landing page to align with the true business strategy revealed in the pitch deck: a complete privacy suite addressing fragmented privacy protection features, positioned as a standalone service while subtly preparing for B2B infrastructure expansion. The update removes Tor associations, enhances professionalism, and creates dedicated documentation components for technical details.
